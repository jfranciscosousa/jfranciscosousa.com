## About me

I&apos;ve been making a living out of web development since my first year of
college. Currently, I&apos;m a full-stack developer at
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://finiam.com">Finiam</a>,
helping our partners untangle the mess of the finance world. I've previously
worked at [Aurora Digital](https://auroradigital.co),
helping make digital products in the health care area. We are all
friends, so drop us a message if you need consulting services in these
areas.

I always considered myself a React and Ruby on Rails developer, but I've
been working professionally with way to many things to limit myself to that
publicly 😅

I've worked with countless frameworks, libraries and languages, but some of
my favorite ones: Next.js, Gatbsy, Eleventy, Elixir (mostly with Phoenix),
Node.js (mostly with Express). You can see all of it on my
<a href="{{ social.github.href }}">Github profile</a>.

I'm also a JAMstack nerd, so I'm a extensive user of Netlify and Vercel.
Serverless functions, static website generators, that sort of things.
