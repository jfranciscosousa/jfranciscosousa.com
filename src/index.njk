  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
    I&apos;ve been making a living out of web development since my first year of
    college. Currently, I&apos;m a full-stack developer at Finiam. While
    focusing on Rails and React, I&apos;m comfortable using (and often seek out)
    other well made, open source tech.

    space? Get in touch with my consulting agency,

    <h2>Tech</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    I've been making stuff on the web since my college days in 2015. I focused
    on the backend initially, but eventually moved into a fullstack approach
    with Ruby (and Rails) and React, dabbing into the functional world with
    Elixir every now and then.
  </p>

  <p>
    Professionally, I've been extensively using monolithical approaches with
    React and Rails. When backend needs are very light, Gatsby or Next with
    headless CMSes (yey for JAMstack) are the tools of choice.

    During my free time I often work on some freelancing projects with some
    designer friends. You can check the open source ones (and other misc stuff)
    on
