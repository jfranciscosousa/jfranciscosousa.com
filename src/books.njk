<p>
  My personal bookshelf. Not much to say, just wanted to make nice things with
  the Goodreads API ðŸ˜›

<section>
  <ul>
    {% for book in books %}
    <li class="text-gray-800 mb-2">
      <a href="{{ book.url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        {{ book.short_title }}
      </a>
      by {{ book.author }}
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
