  <p>
    I've been making stuff on the web since my college days in 2015. I focused
    on the backend initially, but eventually moved into a fullstack approach
    with Ruby (and Rails) and React, dabbing into the functional world with
    Elixir every now and then.
  </p>

  <p>
    Professionally, I've been extensively using monolithical approaches with
    React and Rails. When backend needs are very light, Gatsby or Next with
    headless CMSes (yey for JAMstack) are the tools of choice.
