## About me

I've been making a living out of web development since my first year of college. Currently, I'm a frontend engineer at [Remote](https://remote.com), helping companies employ global talent remotely, all over the world. I work on the payroll vertical, developing internal systems so that our operations team can perform payroll for our customers accross dozens of countries.

Officially I'm a frontend engineer, but I consider myself a full-stack engineer. I'm more focused on frontend since I like to be closer to user needs and prefer to ship tangible features instead of working on behind the scenes platform features. At Remote we use `elixir` but for freelancing and personal projects I often use meta-frameworks like `Next.js`, `Remix`, `svelte-kit` and even `Rails`.

You can see some of my projects on my [Github profile](https://github.com/jfranciscosousa).
