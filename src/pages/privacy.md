## Privacy

I perform simple site analytics with [GoatCounter](http://goatcounter.com/). It collects no information that could identify you. It's all anonymous. Here is the collected data:
- Referrer, whether you visited the site from Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc
- User-Agent, a string sent by your browser that contains: the browser name, browser version, and sometimes operative system.
- The size of your screen
- Country
- Region, for some countries
- The language you defined in your browser

Unique session tracking is disabled, as it's a form of fingerprinting.
