Hi, I'm Francisco and I'm a software engineer that makes websites and web apps. Currently building the foundations of our payroll systems @ [Remote](https://remote.com).

If you like [my work](/projects), feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:francisco.sousa@hey.com)! I can work as a freelancer for short-term projects as a developer or as an advisor long-term.

I also [write stuff](/blog), [build stuff](/projects) and [open-source stuff](https://github.com/jfranciscosousa).
