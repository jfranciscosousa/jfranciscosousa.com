## About me

I've been making a living out of web development since my first year of college. Currently, I'm a frontend engineer at [Remote](https://remote.com), helping companies employ global talent remotely, all over the world.

I've previously worked at [Finiam](https://finiam.com), a web development agency specializing in fintech and Web3. Check them out if you want a world-class agency to build your product.

I've worked with countless frameworks, libraries and languages, but some of my favorite ones: Next.js, Eleventy, Elixir (mostly with Phoenix), Svelte and Remix (also good old Rails). You can see all of it on my [Github profile](https://github.com/jfranciscosousa).
